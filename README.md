A disassembly of the November 3, 1993 prototype of _Sonic the Hedgehog 3_ for the Sega Genesis, based on Esrael's disassembly. Currently compiles into a bit-perfect ROM, although it is still very early on with documentation and organization. Also note that despite the name, the ROM was actually compiled in October; the November 3 date was likely the burn date.
