A disassembly of the November 3, 1993 prototype of _Sonic the Hedgehog 3_ for the Sega Genesis, based on Esrael's disassembly. Currently compiles into a bit-perfect ROM, although it is still very early on with documentation and organization.

Special Thanks:
* Esrael - original disassembly
* Naoto - help with Z80 driver
